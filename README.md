# Compose collection
Collection of useful (and working) docker compose files.

Currently targeting docker compose v.3.9

Deployment examples are based on docker swarm where each compose file is launched as an individual stack. Feel free to use any deployment method you see fit.

Accepting PR's :)

## To get started with docker swarm
```
docker swarm init
```
